* 	Failing Property     * 
* ************************** * 


The failing property of Point3 and Point2 is the transivity property.
The Point3Tests.testTransitivity shows this with the line.

assertEquals(false,p1.equals(p3));

Also, the other tests demonstrate the validity of the other two propertiest (Liskov's
Substitution property & Symmetric Property)

* Statement of Contributions * 
* ************************** * 

Alex Duan wrote the initial Point2 class and Daniel Quintero wrote down the Point3 class
referencing Liskov's pg 182 code. Alex also helped explain what we were supposed to do for
this homework assignment to give us a kickstart. Alex then wrote Point3Tests.testSymmetryP2 and
Point3Tests.testSymmetryP3 which helped get the momemtum going. Daniel then showed that the failing 
property is the transitivity by writing that crucial test case above. Pyoung Kang Kim made sure
that the code is correct and added Point2.equals with the method signiature
Point2 p to fulfill the "overriden" method for Point3. He also added @Override to
ensure that we actually overrode the method intended. He also wrote the
Point3Tests.testSymmetry Point3Tests.testLSPPropertiesRuleCompiles
Point3Tests.testLSPMethoodsRule and Point3Tests.testLSPSigniatureRuleCompiles
and its comments and this FailingProperty_and_StatementOfContribution.txt
file.
