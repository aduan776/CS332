Pyoung Kang Kim wrote the crux of the Junit Theories for this assignment with
Alex Duan writing the Theory " equalsShouldBeSymmetric ". and 
Daniel Quintero writing the Theory " ifEqualsThenHashCodeIsSame ". 

Alex Duan helped Pyoung write up and figure out the ColorPoint class and Point class, 
specifically how to use composition instead of inheritance specifically figuring out 
to write the Point inside the ColorPoint and writing the constructors for both classes.

Daniel Quintero helped write the standard recipe for equals in ColorPoint and Point.
Alex Duan wrote the hashCode for ColorPoint and Point.
