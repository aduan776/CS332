Pyoung Kang Kim wrote the crux of the Junit Theories for this assignment with
Alex Duan writing the Theory " equalsShouldBeSymmetric ". and 
Daniel Quintero writing the Theory " ifEqualsThenHashCodeIsSame ". 

Alex Duan and Pyoung got together online to write up and figure out the ColorPoint class 
and Point class, specifically how to use composition instead of inheritance specifically 
figuring out to write the Point inside the ColorPoint and writing the constructors 
for both classes.

Daniel Quintero wrote the standard recipe for equals in ColorPoint and Point 
along with Alex and Pyoung ensuring correctness.

Alex Duan wrote the hashCode for ColorPoint and Pyoung writing for Point, both following
Bloch's guide.

Daniel Quintero wrote this statement of contribution.
